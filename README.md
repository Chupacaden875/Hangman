This Hangman game in Python offers a classic word-guessing experience where players attempt to uncover a randomly selected fruit word. Featuring console-based interaction, the program validates single-letter guesses, reveals correct letters in the word, and progressively displays a hangman figure for incorrect guesses. The game concludes with victory or defeat based on successful word guessing or exceeding the maximum attempts.
